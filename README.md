This is a completed project built on Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack/~05h). 
The tech used is HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The project consists of solving the problem of a scoreboard. How do we increment points from 1, 2 or 3 points and restart the game from 0 - 0. The solution came entirely from JavaScript.
Here is the live demo: https://dafinlaw.github.io/basketball-scoreboard/
